## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 


### What I learned

i learned how to import Google fonts to my projects, reinforced the concept to center a div, and the fact to base from a model and carry to code it is a great experience

Import Google fonts:

```html
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```


### Continued development

I want to focus on responsive design, how to work with images, use javascript to put something dynamic on the page, and work with others on the same projects using GitHub and ci/cd would be great
